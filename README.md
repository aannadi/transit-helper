Many students in Berkeley use public transportation to get around. With an intricate bus system along with BART, most places in the area are accessible via public transportation.
However, the websites to check departure and arrival times are horrid. Therefore, I created a chatbot that takes in queries about departure/arrival times of Berkeley busses and BART trains and returns real time information via the BART API and the Nextbus API
